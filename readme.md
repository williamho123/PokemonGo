# Pokémon Go Appearance Predictor

### EECS 349 Machine Learning Final Project

The goal of this machine learning project is to predict which Pokémon will appear in the mobile app Pokémon Go given information such as geolocation data, time of sighting, weather, population density, and relative distance to in-game landmarks.

This repository contains helper Python scripts to preprocess our data and the various versions of the dataset after running the scripts.
